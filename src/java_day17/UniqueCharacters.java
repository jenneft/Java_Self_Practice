5. Create a class named UniqueCharacters and write a program that returns the unique characters from a given
string as a map, with each character's frequency as the value. This should be done without using nested loops.

         Example:
               string = "aabcccdeeeef"

         Output:
               {b=1, d=1, f=1}
